# Wizard-Game
This is my attempt at making a survival game 
I'm now turning this into a wizard shooter rogue-like game

Things to work on:
    shooting mechanics:
        - inflict a single instance of damage
    enemy:
        - collide with each other
    bomb:
        - game graphics 
    item spawner:
        - fix 
    consonance changes:
        - each object contain there height and width
        - 
    Map: 
        - Tiling functionality 
        - game graphics 
    Game graphic:
        - learn to animate the images
        - invert based on direction
